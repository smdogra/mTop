# Cutflow to produce Lp distributions used in QCD estimation. To produce nice
# plots, QCD needs to be defined as background. For the actual estimation, QCD
# needs to be defined as signal (to distinguish it from the EWK background)

# Select events with exactly one lepton
1 hard lep: nLep == 1 && Lep_pt > 25

# Veto events with additional leptons
No veto lep: nVeto == 0

# Lepton needs to be selected (For the QCD estimation, we want both selected and
# anti-selected events. They are selected in the mca file, so no cut is applied
# here)
#Selected: Selected == 1

# QCD is measured in an electron sample only
nEl == 1: nEl == 1

# Fire at least one trigger
Trigger: !isData || (HLT_EleOR || HLT_MuOR || HLT_MetOR)

# Prevent double counting from different datasets
Trigger XOR: !isData || ( (PD_SingleEle && HLT_EleOR) || (PD_SingleMu && (HLT_MuOR) && !(HLT_EleOR) ) || (PD_MET && (HLT_MetOR) && !(HLT_EleOR) && !(HLT_MuOR) )  )

# Apply filters
Filters: !isData || METfilters == 1

# Isolated track veto
Iso veto: !iso_Veto

# At least 5 jets
nJet 3 4: nJets30Clean >= 3 && nJets30Clean <= 4

# Second leading jet pT larger than 80 GeV
Jet2_pt > 80: Jet2_pt > 80

# HT baseline selection

# LT baseline selection
